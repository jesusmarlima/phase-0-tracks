# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is a tool that allows you to track changes in files and directories. Using version control you can tell why, when and who changed the files or directories of a project and go back in time to a version that the project had no bugs.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  Branch is a copy of your project to work safely, you can add files and commit in a branch without your original project being affected. Is very useful when you want to work with a team, spike on a story or need to keep new feature development separated for a while.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  Commit is a command you use to tell the version control to create a new save point of the file or directory.

  A good commit massage explains what was changed in the file and folder.

* What is a merge conflict?

  Merge conflict is when version does not know what it have to do to merge files. This situation happens when two people change the same line of a file.
